  # Crisp
  <br>

  

  ## Description: 
  Crisp is a task scheduling app designed to address common user concerns with the existing apps in this market. To present a product that emphasizes the user experience, we focused on implementing a minimalist design with limited features. The result is an easy to use scheduler that doesn't overwhelm the user with excessive options and confusing graphics.
